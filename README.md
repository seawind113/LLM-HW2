# LLM-HW2
This assignment was an advanced one. The first part was text summarization where we had to employ the Google-T5-small model with and without fine-tuning process.  ROUGE-L was the criterion of our model performance. The second part was Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where we had to implement standard, multi-query RAG, and RAG fusion.
